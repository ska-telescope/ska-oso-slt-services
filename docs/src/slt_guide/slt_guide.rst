SLT (Shift Log Tool)
-------------------

For the SKA the intent of the Shift Log Tool is to "harvest" key event information from the main telescope databases, using one "shift log" for each telescope. At the telescope sites the SLT will collect and filter information on all the events taking place during an operational “shift”. This includes informational records and information on failures, warnings and events such as unexpected RFI detection.
