SKA OSO Shift Log Tool Documentation!
=====================================

The Shift Log Tool (SLT) is envisioned as both an “on-line” tool, used in real-time by the operators at the two telescope sites, and as an “off-line” tool,
used at any of the three SKA sites. Its intention is to collate and then provide access to a record of the major events occurring during an operator’s shift.
